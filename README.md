This repository contains a portfolio of machine learning models built using Python mainly for predicting aspects of the healthcare and finance domains. However, I will do others as I explore what is out there.

## üîç Project Overview

All projects leverage publicly available datasets to build classifiers that predict the likelihood of events occuring.

## Existing Projects

- Lung Cancer Predictor (Based on XGBoost and Logloss, detects lung cancer possibility to a 95% accuracy based on factors such as Alcohol Consumption and Coughs)
- Titanic Survival Predictor (Based on Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier with some hyperparameter tuning involved. Predicts the survival and non-survival rates of those aboard the famous Titanic ship)

## Future Projects

I guess we will have to wait and see!
